## Additional Information
For network speed testing, JustVPS uses a system that deploys VPS instances based on your IP address, automatically selecting the closest data center. If you're not satisfied with the default data center, you can switch to another one after deployment. Each switch automatically changes your IP address, resolving any potential issues with banned or blacklisted IPs.

JustVPS provides a pure NVMe SSD array with unlimited data transfer and one free IPv4 address. While packages are offered at various price points, longer purchase cycles tend to have lower monthly rates.
